# Predicting Disaster Tweets

This project was done for the CSE440 (NLP) course at BRAC University. The main idea is to classify tweets to see whether they are related to disasters or not. Social platforms like Twitter (X) are often used for spreading real-time disaster information, so this kind of classification can be helpful.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- NLP (Natural Language Processing)  
- Deep Learning Models: RNN, BiLSTM, GRU, ALBERT  
- Kaggle Disaster Tweet Dataset  

## Objective
We wanted to build a model that can detect disaster-related tweets to help with quick filtering of information during emergencies.

## Models We Used
- RNN (basic model for sequential data)  
- BiLSTM (better for understanding both directions of the text)  
- GRU (simpler version of LSTM)  
- ALBERT (a lighter version of BERT model)  

## Results
- **RNN:** Around 77% accuracy  
- **BiLSTM:** Around 80% accuracy  
- **GRU:** Around 79% accuracy  
- **ALBERT:** Gave the best result, around 82% accuracy  

These results are based on the Kaggle dataset we used for training and testing.

## My Role (Prachurja Bhattacharjee)
- Worked on data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Implemented BiLSTM and GRU models  
- Helped compare the model performances  
- Contributed to writing the report and managing the GitHub repo
